# Fortinet Security Fabric Demo

## üéØ Goal
Demonstrate **Fortinet Security Fabric automation** across **hybrid and public cloud environments**.

---

## üß© Context

This demonstration is designed purely for **educational and proof-of-concept** purposes.

Under normal conditions, a **FortiGate IPS profile** would typically detect and block traffic to known malicious IP addresses.  
However, in today‚Äôs threat landscape ‚Äî especially with **zero-day attacks** and **rapidly evolving attacker infrastructure** ‚Äî not every suspicious IP is immediately classified as ‚Äúbad.‚Äù

This is where **FortiCNAPP** significantly enhances the Fortinet Security Fabric.  
By combining **composite indicators** with **advanced anomaly detection**, it can identify unusual callback activity even when the IP has not yet been flagged as malicious.

This capability is particularly powerful in detecting early signs of:
- **Data exfiltration**
- **Ransomware callbacks**
- **Compromised hosts** communicating with external command-and-control servers

Together, FortiGate, FortiAnalyzer, and FortiCNAPP provide **visibility and protection** well beyond traditional, signature-based defenses.
