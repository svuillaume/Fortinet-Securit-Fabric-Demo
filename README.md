# Fortinet Security Fabric Demo

## 🎯 Goal
Demonstrate **Fortinet Security Fabric automation** across **hybrid and public cloud environments**.

---

## 🧩 Context

This demonstration is designed purely for **educational and proof-of-concept** purposes.

Under normal conditions, a **FortiGate IPS profile** would typically detect and block traffic to known malicious IP addresses.  
However, in today’s threat landscape — especially with **zero-day attacks** and **rapidly evolving attacker infrastructure** — not every suspicious IP is immediately classified as “bad.”

This is where **FortiCNAPP** significantly enhances the Fortinet Security Fabric.  
By combining **composite indicators** with **advanced anomaly detection**, it can identify unusual callback activity even when the IP has not yet been flagged as malicious.

# Early Threat Detection Capabilities

This capability is particularly powerful in detecting early signs of:

- **Highly Dynamic IP environment** (where IP sources constantly change)
- **API Protection against DDoS Attacks**
- **Data Exfiltration**
- **Ransomware Callbacks**
- **Compromised Hosts** communicating with external command-and-control servers

Together, FortiGate, FortiAnalyzer, and FortiCNAPP provide **visibility and protection** well beyond traditional, signature-based defenses.
